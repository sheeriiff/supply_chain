# Supply Chain Dataset Analysis
Project Highlights:

◆ Data Modeling, Cleaning, and Preprocessing with Python

We prepared the data through several steps:

• Identified negative values using the describe function
• Checked for duplicates with an if statement
• Detected outliers with box plots
• Conducted univariate analysis using box plots and histograms


◆ Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib

After assessing correlations between columns, we tackled questions such as:

• What is the impact of product category on revenue?
• How do customer demographics influence purchasing behavior for different product types?
• What effect do suppliers have on purchasing behaviors across product types?
• How do transportation modes impact manufacturing lead times?


◆ Data Visualization with Tableau

To showcase our findings, we created an interactive dashboard in Tableau. This dashboard highlights key insights, making it easy to see the main factors affecting the supply chain, such as revenue, customer behavior, and lead times.

This experience has been a wonderful opportunity to advance my skills in data analysis while utilizing tools like Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, and Tableau. Working on a variety of projects has enhanced my analytical thinking and teamwork capabilities, preparing me for future endeavors in the data field.
